I work for a global tech company, but I still can't seem to keep my hands off the keyboard in my free time.
I consider myself to be a consultant, technical writer, developer, system administrator, as well as a designer.
I'm always in the process of learning something new, constantly trying to get my head around some novel tool, technique or software library.
As a big nerd I'm particularly interested in storage, security, automation, web technologies, digital rights and digital culture, as well as Linux and open source software.
When I'm not in front of a computer screen, you can find me listening to podcasts, taking pictures, cycling, running, or playing Nintendo Switch.

My [personal website](https://www.byteshell.net) or my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/acch) are good starting points to learn more about how I <del>waste</del> spend my time. You can also read a more formal [resume](http://resume.achim-christ.de) if you prefer.
